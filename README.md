# Explanation of Design and Technical Decisions:

React is chosen as the frontend library for its component-based structure, making it easier to manage UI elements. Tailwind CSS is used for styling due to its utility-first approach, allowing rapid development and easy customization.

Horizontal scrolling is implemented to enhance user experience, especially when showcasing multiple events horizontally. This allows users to quickly scroll through available options without excessive vertical navigation.

Infinite scroll is implemented to provide a seamless browsing experience, particularly for long lists of events. This feature automatically loads more content as the user scrolls down, eliminating the need for pagination and reducing user effort.


Overall, the project aims to provide users with a user-friendly platform to discover and book events easily, leveraging React for dynamic UI rendering and Tailwind CSS for responsive and visually appealing design. Improving image hosting and handling would enhance the overall functionality and aesthetics of the website.
